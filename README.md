## Not entirely sure how to organize this yet but for now its a link dump to help keep my pins clear

## Original posts: 
* [No its NOT a virus](https://github.com/elbadcode/NoItsNotaVirus/blob/main/README.md)
  not strictly mod related but helps to demonstrate the folly in trusting virus scanners
  useful to link against for any tool developers, though of course it can't help the reading challenged who are most susceptible to this issue

## Docs for other people's work 
* [ReShade Effect Shader Toggler Constant Buffer Extraction Tutorial](https://github.com/elbadcode/ReshadeEffectShaderToggler/wiki/Constant-Buffer-Extraction-in-Action)
  useful for exploring the concept of cbs in action but mainly explains usage of the software
  with a practical example recreating a common game mechanic from scratch in shaders
  PR still open - requires author to accept PR, download my docs from the repo and manually upload to publish a wiki page, or give me edit rights
* [Unreal Modding tools](https://github.com/elbadcode/UE-Modding-Tools)
  Added section about 3dmigoto with some additional info on specific games using it as well as info on wuthering waves modding and links to relevant communities
  PR still open - just needs to be accepted after fulfilling any change requets

# Not a document but it counts as an info dump because it dumps info for analysis 
* [dxbc_reader packed exe](https://github.com/elbadcode/dxbc_reader)
  crammed 3dmigoto hlsl decompiler/disassembler and a bytecode parser into a standalone exe
